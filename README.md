What is LAPS?

LAPS is/was a project created by Arthur Howard and TJ Lander to create a bot that plays pokemon online.

It won 1st place at our local community colleges computer fair, but we were the only group of programmers...

How do I use this?

You probably don't want to, as of right now the program plays on a very basic level, and has bugs that stop it from functioning.

However if you want to try it out, or just mess around with selenium I will try to explain the program.

How to use
___
1. Take the data files and put them in a folder (immunities,login,moves,pokerepo,resistance,weakness)
2. Open the pokeplayer file with your favorite java editor
3. if you dont already have it find the gecko driver for your operating system, then put it in the same folder as the data files
4. go to bottom of pokeplayer look in the main, and see the player.setpath("setyourpath") change the path to the location of the data files
5. change the login file to have your login info, it should be in the form shown "username-password", you can also just use the gui
6. That should be it, have fun!
